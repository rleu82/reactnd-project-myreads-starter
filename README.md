# MyReads Project

This is book tracking App that Udacity provided starter files for. Using react we were to create functionality while demonstrating an understanding of passing and updating props and states, components, routes, and other react concepts.

## Setup

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Navigate to project directory in your terminal and install project dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the server by typing `npm start`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` and the application should appear.

## Using the App

Book titles are sorted into `Currently Reading`, `Want to Read`, and `Read`. They can be moved by clicking the green button at the bottom right of each book and selecting the shelf to move the book into. Selecting `none` will remove the book from all shelves.

The search page is accessed through the large "`+`" sign at the bottom right of the page. Search terms were limited for this project and provided in SEARCH_TERMS.md.

`I provided a dropdown of the search terms that will display results as you select them`.
